[Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts-notifications/fbpmaadfebbedknhmeeijeicldjlegee)

Chrome Extension which adds Chrome notifications to the Hangouts webchat.

It supports multiple Hangouts instances (if you're using Gmail along with Hangouts a tab) and adds an *Online* notification.

**Remember!** You need to keep your gmail, inbox or hangouts tab open for the extension to work. I am not affiliated with Google in any way, so it's the best that I can do :)

## Notifies you when

- A contact becomes online

- There's a new chat message

## Configuration

Both types of notifications can be disabled from the options page.

The extension also recognizes when notifications are muted from Hangouts (or a single convesation is muted), lets you mute all notifications except for certain users and more!
